# Nuxt Content-specific Vue components

All `Prose*` components adjust the default rendering of Nuxt Content, i.e. all
(Markdown) pages in `content/`.
The components are originally copied from https://github.com/nuxt/content
`src/runtime/components/Prose` (commit ee83de8, 2023-02-07) and should be kept
in sync with the upstream ones.
